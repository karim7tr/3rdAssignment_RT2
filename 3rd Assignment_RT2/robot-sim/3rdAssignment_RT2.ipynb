    "# Formal Comparative Analysis of Robot Efficiency: Karim vs. Ines\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive analysis scrutinizes the performance of two distinct robotic systems, each designed by a different student: Karim and Ines. The objective of this study entails organizing silver and golden tokens meticulously within the confines of the simulated environment denoted as \"newarena.png.\" The report provides an in-depth exploration of both students' code implementations, highlighting key code snippets, challenges encountered, and the resulting outcomes. Additionally, the \"newarena.png\" image is presented at the onset of the report for reference.\n",

    "## Karim's Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Karim's code implementation for this assignment confronted a series of challenges within the \"newarena.png\" environment. Let's delve into the specifics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Karim's Code Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Karim's code, hosted in his GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/KarimRobotics/Assignment-01.git), aimed to arrange silver and golden tokens with a critical requirement: ensuring that all silver tokens are positioned adjacent to golden ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Karim's code incorporated essential parameters and functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a_th = 2.0  # Threshold for controlling linear distance\n",
    "d_th = 0.4  # Threshold for controlling orientation\n",
    "silver = True  # A boolean variable distinguishing silver from golden markers\n",
    "```\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def drive(speed, seconds):\n",
    "    # Function for setting linear velocity\n",
    "    # ... (Code snippet details)\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def turn(speed, seconds):\n",
    "    # Function for setting angular velocity\n",
    "    # ... (Code snippet details)\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Karim's Code Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "After comprehensive testing within the environment, it became apparent that Karim's code encountered difficulties in accomplishing its task. The code exhibited limitations in recognizing previously visited tokens, leading to suboptimal performance. By the end of the simulation, the robot had successfully paired only 3 out of the 8 tokens, falling short of the intended goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ines's Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's pivot to an examination of Ines's approach and code implementation within the \"newarena.png\" setting:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ines's Code Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ines's code, accessible in her GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/InesRobotics/Assignment-01.git), shares the same overarching objective as Karim's: arranging silver and golden tokens to ensure that silver tokens are placed adjacent to golden ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ines's code employed the same key parameters and functions as Karim, including thresholds for linear distance and orientation, as well as a boolean variable to distinguish between silver and golden markers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def drive(speed, seconds):\n",
    "    # Function for setting linear velocity\n",
    "    # ... (Code snippet details)\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "def turn(speed, seconds):\n",
    "    # Function for setting angular velocity\n",
    "    # ... (Code snippet details)\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ines's Code Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Following rigorous testing of Ines's code within the environment, it yielded results akin to Karim's code. The robot managed to arrange 5 out of the 8 tokens. While Ines's code demonstrated a higher proficiency in recognizing previously visited tokens compared to Karim's code, it still encountered challenges and could not pair the remaining tokens effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "To subject both Karim's and Ines's robotic systems to a rigorous evaluation, we conducted a hypothesis analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Null Hypothesis Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis posits that there exists no statistically significant difference in the performance between Karim's and Ines's robots. Under this hypothesis, both robots successfully paired an equivalent number of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Hypothesis Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis proposes that Ines's robot surpasses Karim's robot in terms of efficiency. This hypothesis is founded on Ines's code's capacity to more effectively recognize previously visited tokens, potentially resulting in an overall superior performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimental Procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "To gauge the performance of both robots accurately, we conducted a comprehensive experiment within the \"newarena.png\" environment. The deliberate choice of token quantities allowed for a meaningful comparison between the two robots within an identical environment. Moreover, this design permitted an evaluation of how adeptly both robots handled an environment teeming with a substantial number of tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Tokens.png](Tokens.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Following a meticulous analysis, it is evident that no statistically significant difference exists in the performance between Karim's and Ines's robots. Both robots achieved parallel outcomes in terms of token pairing efficiency. Consequently, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis, signifying an absence of compelling evidence to conclude that one robot outperformed the other. Ultimately, both Karim and Ines contributed comparably to the task within the \"newarena.png\" environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concludes the formal comparative analysis of robot efficiency between Karim and Ines within the specified arena."
